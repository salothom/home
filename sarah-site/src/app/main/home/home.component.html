      <div *ngIf="mainShow==='About'">
        I am a software developer living in Austin, Texas. Originally from the Chicago 'burbs, I got my undergrad from
        Indiana University's School of Infromatics and Computer Science then headed down to warmer weather. Check out
        the books I've been reading or see the list of albums I'm attempting to work my way through this year. If you
        have any reccomendations on either, I'd truly love to hear them.

        <p>Established in 2017, Books & Booze is a community book club located in Austin, Texas.
          Founded with the idea to have great conversations about books we wouldn't nessisarily pick up by ourselves,
          this book club has lead its members through story lines and to many different local coffee shops,
          breweries, and patios. With monthly meetings, and a sprawling range of genres, there is only one rule of the
          club</p>
        <ol>
          <li>No books where the dog dies</li>

        <p>This list comes from personal challenge to listen to at least 150 albums in 2020 with “fresh ears”, to maybe
          write snippets of my
          thoughts when listening to them, and to score them out of 7. This in part came from a desire to not only have
          additional excuses to reach out and talk to
          people whom I care about, but also to expand the genres and albums I listen to on a daily bases. This list is
          compiled from over 30 people. I asked them
          the
          simple question: “If you were going to make a list of albums that people should have listened to, what’s a
          couple albums that would be on your version?”.
