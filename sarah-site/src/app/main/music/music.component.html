      <p>A personal challenge to listen to at least 150 albums with “fresh ears” and to write snippets of my thoughts
        when
        listening to them. The second part came from a desire to have additional excuses to reach out and talk to people
        who I care about who might not live where I do. This list is compiled from over 30 people. I asked them the
        simple question: “If you were going to make a list of albums that people should have listened to, what’s a
        couple albums that would be on your version?”.

        My mom says that asking what music people should listen to is “kind of like asking what fruit you should eat?
        Like, just about everything you can get your hands on.”s

      <p>
        Below is the list that I got my hands on.
